Getting Eclipse CDT:
====================
If you do not have Eclipse with CDT installed, please install them before invoking the scripts in 
this directory.

    Eclipse is available at http://www.eclipse.org.
    CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling) is available at http://www.eclipse.org/cdt.


Importing Torc projects from the command line:
==============================================
Be sure to add Eclipse to your PATH environment variable.  You can then import the Torc projects 
into eclipse on a one-time basis with import-projects.sh.  After the projects have been imported, 
you can reopen Eclipse with open-eclipse.sh.

	./import-projects.sh


Importing Torc projects from inside Eclipse:
============================================
If you prefer to import the Torc projects manually, you may do so as follows:

    File -> Import... -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace

Select torc/trunk as the root directory, and click the Finish button.


Importing the Torc code formatter profile into Eclipse:
=======================================================
This directory includes a code formatter profile for Eclipse, conforming to the Torc style guide 
as defined in spec/style/CodingStyle.pdf.  That profile can be imported into Eclipse projects to 
apply the Torc style guide.  You may select the following from inside Eclipse:

	Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Code Style -> Import...

When prompted for a file, select CodeFormatterProfile.xml.
