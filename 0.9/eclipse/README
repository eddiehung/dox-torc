Getting Eclipse CDT:
====================
If you do not have Eclipse with CDT installed, please install them before invoking the scripts in 
this directory.

    Eclipse is available at http://www.eclipse.org.
    CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling) is available at http://www.eclipse.org/cdt.


Importing Torc projects from the command line:
==============================================
Be sure to add Eclipse to your PATH environment variable.  You can then import the Torc projects 
into eclipse on a one-time basis with import-projects.sh.  After the projects have been imported, 
you can reopen Eclipse with open-eclipse.sh.


Importing Torc projects from inside Eclipse:
============================================
If you prefer to import the Torc projects manually, you may do so as follows:

    File -> Import... -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace

Select torc/trunk as the root directory, and click the Finish button.
