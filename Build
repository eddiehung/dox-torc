Code, Examples, and Tests
=========================

Building the default target compiles all of the source code, and links the example and unit test 
executables.

	cd src
	make

The following examples are also available in the sandbox mentioned below, where they can safely be 
modified.  The examples demonstrate the basic operation of the main Torc APIs, and can be invoked 
as follows:

	./architecture_example
	./bitstream_example regression/VirtexUnitTest.reference.bit
	./generic_example regression/GenericExample.reference.edf
	./physical_example regression/DesignUnitTest.reference.xdl
	./edif_obfuscator regression/GenericExample.reference.edf

The unit and regression tests are available through the test executable.  Individual test suites or 
tests can be invoked by passing -t and one or more suites or test cases separated by commas.

	./test

The test app can also be built with Xcode, by opening project xcode/torc.xcodeproj.  The test app 
can likewise be built with Eclipse, by importing the projects in src and sandbox.  With recent 
versions of Eclipse and CDT, the projects can be imported with utility scripts in the eclipse 
directory.

Sandbox
=======

The sandbox is available for quick experimentation with Torc.  The sandbox examples are identical 
to the examples in src/torc/Examples, but may be modified the user.  Note that building inside the 
sandbox also compiles all of the source code in src.

	cd sandbox
	make

Doxygen Documentation
=====================

The Doxygen documentation can be built as follows:

	cd src
	doxygen Doxyfile

Doxygen is available from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/.
